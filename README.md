Sports, as a universal language and cultural cornerstone, play a crucial role in promoting physical health, mental resilience, and community spirit. Among these, badminton stands out as one of the most popular sports worldwide, known for its fast-paced rallies, skillful techniques, and the athletic agility it demands from players.

In badminton, player monitoring and stroke identification are particularly vital for understanding gameplay and enhancing training regimens. This project addresses these areas by focusing on the classification of badminton strokes, specifically categorizing them into forehand and backhand. Using a dataset of 1,000 images captured from various match videos, this project applies machine learning techniques to distinguish between these two types of strokes, enabling a deeper understanding of player strategies and stroke mechanics![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca00aa4-c880-4089-83a1-d460f1a4077f)
